// check the website: regex101.com amazing to text regex but also to review and security validations
in regex:
\d -> search
^ -> grab only the row's 1st positions
$ -> always finish with $ to indicate that the expression finishes at each row.
/g -> within entire row
/gm -> multiline
[.-] -> between brackets [] to indicate OR. So, it could be a dot . OR a dash -

123.123.123-14
321.123.345-20
200.300.500-19

So, the regex will be: 
^\d{3}.\d{3}.\d{3}-\d{2}$

At VSCode -> Ctrl+F -> [.-] and use the option .* (which indicates regex)
VSCode will find all and I can replace with whatever I want (like with empty just to clear data)


Passos, Leandro
Gomes, Laila
Johnson, Jose
/w -> each letter
/w+ -> every letter until find something different from a letter
, -> find comma ,
\s -> space

\w+,\s\w+

/^(\w+),(\s\w+)$/gm -> parenthesis split data per groups

So, in VSCode we can find & replace:

SEARCH:
^(\w+),\s(\w+)$

AND REPLACE FOR: 
{firstName: "$2", lastName: "$1"}
because $2 is a reference for the group 2 between the parenthesis in the regex

THE TEXT:

Passos, Leandro
Gomes, Laila
Johnson, Jose

TURNS INTO:

{firstName: "Leandro", lastName: "Passos"}
{firstName: "Laila", lastName: "Gomes"}
{firstName: "Jose", lastName: "Johnson"}

Now let's change from markdown to html:

Ah e pode pesquisar no [Google](https://google.com) ou
[Yahoo](https://yahoo.com)
vai que vai!

/\[(.*?)]/gm -> everything between [ ] go to a group. We need the "?" otherwise it goest until the last "]", but we want it to stop for each "]"
? is a good practice for regex, let it know that it doesn't need to search in the entire text, just goes until this specific character, in this case "]"
\(([http|https].*)\) -> select everything .* between parenthesis. But as parenthesis is a group selector we need to use \( and \)

So, in VSCode we can find & replace:

SEARCH:
\[(.*?)\]\(([http|https].*?)\) 

AND REPLACE FOR:
<a href="$2">$1</a>
